#### Introduction to AWS Serverless Architecture

Serverless (Serverless Architecture) is a cloud computing execution model that allows you to build and run applications without needing to manage, operate, or maintain physical or virtual server infrastructure.

- **Faster time-to-market:** Development teams can quickly bring ideas to life and ship new features without being blocked by infrastructure concerns.

- **Cost optimization:** Maximize budget efficiency by completely eliminating the cost of maintaining idle resources.

- **High reliability and security:** Easily apply AWS's strict security standards along with fine-grained IAM policies for precise access control.
